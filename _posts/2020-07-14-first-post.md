Took me around 3 to 4 days to set up completely.


This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllnow.com) and hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'll be using this blog to share my thoughts and ideas on the internet. Mostly related to programming, personal experiences, books, hobbies, and the stuff which I am into. Hope you find them interesting and useful.

There are a few more changes which have to be implemented I'll be doing it whenever I get the time. But for now, this is it.

Few of the changes to be added are 
* [ ]  Include Disqus Comments plugin. In the meantime, if you can contact me using [email](mailto:sudhanaboina.rahul@gmail.com).

* [ ]  Fixing UI bugs and hyperlinks.

As time moves, I'll be adding more. 

Good Bye for now.
